# It's All Funds and Games

This is a logistic regression project using Kickstarter data for CSE40647 - Data Science.

## Progress

To see the progress of the project, look at the Funds_Games.pdf file in the repository.

We currently have results for six different models with the variables that are not string-related.

The evaluation metrics used are accuracy, precision, recall, F-1 score, AUC, and zero-one loss. Additionally, an ROC curve is plotted using the matplotlib library.

## Running the Notebook

This project uses Python 3.6.4, and the following packages: numpy, pandas, cufflinks, sklearn, graphviz, and matplotlib.

Make sure the repo is cloned in full, including the data.

Follow along with each cell; those that use grid-search usually take longer than those without.

## Conclusions


### Milestone Report

The full report can be seen in the Milestone_Presentation.pdf file in the directory.

Below are the preliminary results on the classifiers.
